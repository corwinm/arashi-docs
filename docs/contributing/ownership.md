## Ownership Model

- Primary owner group: `arashi-maintainers`.
- Maintainers review and approve structural navigation changes.
- Contributors can author content updates through pull requests.

## Maintenance Expectations

- Keep onboarding, command, and contribution pages current with product behavior.
- Respond to validation failures and broken-link reports quickly.
- Review docs home and contributor workflows before major releases.

## Response Targets

- Critical docs outages: acknowledge within one business day.
- Broken canonical docs URL: remediate immediately.
- Standard content PR review: first response within two business days.
