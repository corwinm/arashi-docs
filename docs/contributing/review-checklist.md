Use this list when reviewing changes that affect navigation or first-time user experience.

## Discoverability Checks

- [ ] The docs home page still presents clear links to Getting Started, Commands, and Contributing.
- [ ] New content is linked from at least one existing entry page.
- [ ] Terminology remains consistent with the docs site conventions.
- [ ] All updated links use canonical docs paths and resolve correctly.
- [ ] Any navigation change follows [Navigation Rules](/contributing/navigation-rules/).

## README Link Checks

- [ ] If docs URL changed, `repos/arashi/README.md` points to the canonical URL.
- [ ] The canonical URL appears in docs home and matches `repos/arashi/README.md`.
