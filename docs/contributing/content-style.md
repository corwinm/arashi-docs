Use these conventions for all pages under `docs/`.

## Writing Rules

- Write for user outcomes first, implementation detail second.
- Use active voice and short paragraphs.
- Prefer concrete command examples with expected context.
- Keep terminology consistent: use "documentation site" for `arashi-docs`.

## Formatting Rules

- Use one `#` heading per page through frontmatter title.
- Use `##` and `###` headings in logical order.
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers.
- Use absolute docs links like `/contributing/navigation-rules/`.

## Maintenance Rules

- Update cross-links when adding, moving, or deleting pages.
- Include a short description in frontmatter.
- Keep onboarding and contributor workflow guidance in their matching sections.
